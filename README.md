# Robot Car Sim Ray Wall Detection P5 Js

Raycast system I copied from Daniel Shiffman's code, I modified and put ray on movable object (I presume this as robot car).
This project is my pending project to learn how robot car can do room mapping with ultrasonic sensor, and this project objectives is to simulate that with the help of P5.js.

What To Do:
  - ~~Create Robot Car Movement~~
  - ~~Put Ray cast sensor in Robot car~~
  - ~~Make random wall to be detected~~
  - ~~Create a mark on detected position~~
  - Memory Optimization of the marked position
  - Make a line prediction on a group of marks
  - ...
  - ...
